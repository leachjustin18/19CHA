Created a test that shows a defintion and the user has to guess which word it belongs to.  The user can hover over each term to get a defintion for that specific word. After hovering out the defintion will clear out.  The quiz allows you to keep guessing until the user gets the correct answer.  If the user gets a incorrect answer text appears saying "Please try again" then dissapears.  Once they get it correct, the word "Correct!" appears and dissapears showing the next question button.  The answers are compared to an array to see if they are correct and pulls the different defintions from that array.
